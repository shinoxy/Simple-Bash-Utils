Here I implemented cat and grep bash commands that work on MacOS and Linux. 

Commands' functionality is limited. There are made:

● -b, -e, -n, -s, -t options, their combinations and GNU analogues for cat. 

● -e -i -v -c -s -n -h -l -o options and their PAIR compinations for grep.

● Multiple file support

Usage:
cat [options] [file]
grep [options] template [file]

Code follows the Google style.
